Web Site Shared Reading 

-->Description:
  Shared Reading is a collaborative reading project that allows multiple users to share the experience of exchanging books. Its main objective is to facilitate the reuse of books, not only by reading and preserving them, but also by ensuring that the book reaches another person, thus promoting reading among different users. <BR>
  This web platform is developed with React as the frontend interface framework, and for the backend, I created a simulation using json-server and db.json.

-->Features:
  - Dynamic Inventory Management (CRUD): A complete system for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books or users in real time, synchronized with a dynamic database (db.json).
  - Data Visualization Panel: Use of ApexCharts to transform flat data into interactive charts that display reading statistics for books or users.
  - Advanced Form Management: Validated forms for user registration and book uploads, ensuring data integrity before sending it to the server.
  - Search and Filtering Logic: Efficient algorithms for filtering the book collection by author, genre, or status, improving the user's search experience.
  - Session Persistence: User management using cookies and local storage, allowing sessions and preferences to be maintained even when the webpage is reloaded.
  - Asynchronous Data Retrieval: Consumption of RESTful APIs through data retrieval, with management of load states and errors.
  - Responsive Design: An adaptable interface that ensures smooth navigation on both computers and mobile devices.
